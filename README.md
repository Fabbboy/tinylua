## TinyLua

TinyLua is a small Lua interpreter/compiler written in pure C. It has no purpose just for fun and learning. It is not intended to be used in production.

### Superset of Lua (I guess???)
### Types!!!!!
```lua
local a = 1 -- infers int
local b: int = 1 -- int
local c: float = 1.0 -- float
```
